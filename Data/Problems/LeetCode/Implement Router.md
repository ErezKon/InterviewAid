## 1. Problem Description

Design a data structure that can efficiently manage data packets in a network router. Each data packet consists of the following attributes:

- `source`: A unique identifier for the machine that generated the packet.
- `destination`: A unique identifier for the target machine.
- `timestamp`: The time at which the packet arrived at the router.

Implement the `Router` class:

`Router(int memoryLimit)`: Initializes the Router object with a fixed memory limit.

- `memoryLimit` is the **maximum** number of packets the router can store at any given time.
- If adding a new packet would exceed this limit, the **oldest** packet must be removed to free up space.

`bool addPacket(int source, int destination, int timestamp)`: Adds a packet with the given attributes to the router.

- A packet is considered a duplicate if another packet with the same `source`, `destination`, and `timestamp` already exists in the router.
- Return `true` if the packet is successfully added (i.e., it is not a duplicate); otherwise return `false`.

`int[] forwardPacket()`: Forwards the next packet in FIFO (First In First Out) order.

- Remove the packet from storage.
- Return the packet as an array `[source, destination, timestamp]`.
- If there are no packets to forward, return an empty array.

`int getCount(int destination, int startTime, int endTime)`:

- Returns the number of packets currently stored in the router (i.e., not yet forwarded) that have the specified destination and have timestamps in the inclusive range `[startTime, endTime]`.

**Note** that queries for `addPacket` will be made in non-decreasing order of `timestamp`.

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= memoryLimit <= 10^5`
- `1 <= source, destination <= 2 * 10^5`
- `1 <= timestamp <= 10^9`
- `1 <= startTime <= endTime <= 10^9`
- At most `10^5` calls will be made to `addPacket`, `forwardPacket`, and `getCount` methods altogether.
- queries for `addPacket` will be made in non-decreasing order of `timestamp`.

## 2. Approach: Queue + Set + Binary Search ✅

```
CLASS Router:
    // Queue with capacity, deduplication, and forwarding
    FUNCTION addPacket(source, destination, timestamp): bool
        // Reject if duplicate (src, dst, ts) or queue full
    FUNCTION forwardPacket(): [source, destination, timestamp]
        // Dequeue front packet
    FUNCTION getCount(destination, startTime, endTime): int
        // Binary search on sorted timestamps per destination
```

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ["Router", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "forwardPacket", "addPacket", "getCount"]
[[3], [1, 4, 90], [2, 5, 90], [1, 4, 90], [3, 5, 95], [4, 5, 105], [], [5, 2, 110], [5, 100, 110]]
Output: [null, true, true, false, true, true, [2, 5, 90], true, 1]
Explanation:
Router router = new Router(3); // Initialize Router with memoryLimit of 3.
router.addPacket(1, 4, 90); // Packet is added. Return True.
router.addPacket(2, 5, 90); // Packet is added. Return True.
router.addPacket(1, 4, 90); // This is a duplicate packet. Return False.
router.addPacket(3, 5, 95); // Packet is added. Return True
router.addPacket(4, 5, 105); // Packet is added, [1, 4, 90] is removed as number of packets exceeds memoryLimit. Return True.
router.forwardPacket(); // Return [2, 5, 90] and remove it from router.
router.addPacket(5, 2, 110); // Packet is added. Return True.
router.getCount(5, 100, 110); // The only packet with destination 5 and timestamp in the inclusive range [100, 110] is [4, 5, 105]. Return 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ["Router", "addPacket", "forwardPacket", "forwardPacket"]
[[2], [7, 4, 90], [], []]
Output: [null, true, [7, 4, 90], []]
Explanation:
Router router = new Router(2); // Initialize Router with memoryLimit of 2.
router.addPacket(7, 4, 90); // Return True.
router.forwardPacket(); // Return [7, 4, 90].
router.forwardPacket(); // There are no packets left, return [].
```

## Walkthrough

| Step | Operation | Queue State | Set State | Destination Map |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | addPacket(1,2,5) | [(1,2,5)] | {(1,2,5)} | {2: [5]} |
| 2 | addPacket(1,2,5) | unchanged | unchanged (duplicate) | unchanged |
| 3 | forwardPacket() | [] | {} | {2: []} |
| 4 | getCount(2,0,10) | [] | {} | returns 0 |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** `addPacket` O(log k) for binary-search insertion into the per-destination list (k = packets for that destination). `forwardPacket` O(1). `getCount` O(log k).
- **Space:** O(n) to store all packets, where n is the number of packets currently in the router.

## Key Takeaway

> Use a queue for FIFO, a set for deduplication, and per-destination sorted lists with binary search for range count queries.
