## Problem Description

A spreadsheet is a grid with 26 columns (labeled from `'A'` to `'Z'`) and a given number of `rows`. Each cell in the spreadsheet can hold an integer value between 0 and 10^5.

Implement the `Spreadsheet` class:

- `Spreadsheet(int rows)` Initializes a spreadsheet with 26 columns (labeled `'A'` to `'Z'`) and the specified number of rows. All cells are initially set to 0.
- `void setCell(String cell, int value)` Sets the value of the specified `cell`. The cell reference is provided in the format `"AX"` (e.g., `"A1"`, `"B10"`), where the letter represents the column (from `'A'` to `'Z'`) and the number represents a **1-indexed** row.
- `void resetCell(String cell)` Resets the specified cell to 0.
- `int getValue(String formula)` Evaluates a formula of the form `"=X+Y"`, where `X` and `Y` are **either** cell references or non-negative integers, and returns the computed sum.

**Note:** If `getValue` references a cell that has not been explicitly set using `setCell`, its value is considered 0.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= rows <= 10^3`
- `0 <= value <= 10^5`
- The formula is always in the format `"=X+Y"`, where `X` and `Y` are either valid cell references or **non-negative** integers with values less than or equal to `10^5`.
- Each cell reference consists of a capital letter from `'A'` to `'Z'` followed by a row number between `1` and `rows`.
- At most `10^4` calls will be made in **total** to `setCell`, `resetCell`, and `getValue`.

## Examples

```
Example 1:
  Input:
  ["Spreadsheet", "getValue", "setCell", "getValue", "setCell", "getValue", "resetCell", "getValue"]
  [[3], ["=5+7"], ["A1", 10], ["=A1+6"], ["B2", 15], ["=A1+B2"], ["A1"], ["=A1+B2"]]
  Output:
  [null, 12, null, 16, null, 25, null, 15]
  Explanation:
  Spreadsheet spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet(3); // Initializes a spreadsheet with 3 rows and 26 columns
  spreadsheet.getValue("=5+7");  // returns 12 (5+7)
  spreadsheet.setCell("A1", 10); // sets A1 to 10
  spreadsheet.getValue("=A1+6"); // returns 16 (10+6)
  spreadsheet.setCell("B2", 15); // sets B2 to 15
  spreadsheet.getValue("=A1+B2"); // returns 25 (10+15)
  spreadsheet.resetCell("A1");   // resets A1 to 0
  spreadsheet.getValue("=A1+B2"); // returns 15 (0+15)
```

## Approach

```
CLASS Spreadsheet:
    CONSTRUCTOR(rows):
        cells = {}    // "A1" → value

    FUNCTION setCell(cell, value):
        cells[cell] = value

    FUNCTION getCell(cell):
        RETURN cells.get(cell, 0)

    FUNCTION setFormula(cell, formula):
        // Parse formula (e.g., "=A1+B2")
        // Evaluate by resolving cell references
        cells[cell] = evaluate(formula)
```

## Walkthrough

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `setCell("A1", 5)` | cells["A1"] = 5 |
| 2 | `setFormula("B1", "=A1+3")` | evaluate reads A1 → 5, adds 3 → 8, stores cells["B1"] = 8 |
| 3 | `resetCell("A1")` | cells["A1"] = 0, re‑evaluate B1 → 3 |

## Complexity Analysis

- `setCell` / `getCell` / `resetCell`: **O(1)** time, **O(1)** space.
- `setFormula`: parsing & evaluating touches each referenced cell → **O(k)** where *k* is number of references.
- Overall storage: **O(m)** for *m* cells.

## Follow-Up Questions

- How would you detect and handle circular dependencies?
- Extend to support built‑in functions like `SUM` over ranges.
- Design a collaborative version with concurrent edits.

## Key Takeaway

> **Hash map of cell references. Simple case: store values directly. With formulas: parse and evaluate by resolving cell references recursively. Watch for circular dependencies.**
